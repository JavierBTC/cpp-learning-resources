# C++ Learning Resources

A collection of notes, resources, and code examples to help learn C++. This repository is organized by topic, covering foundational concepts, Object-Oriented Programming, the Standard Template Library, advanced topics, and practice exercises. Each section includes explanations and code snippets to support your learning journey.

## Table of Contents
- [Basics](./Basics): Foundational topics including variables, data types, control structures, and functions. This section provides the building blocks of C++.
- [OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)](./OOP): Covers Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation for modular and maintainable code.
- [STL (Standard Template Library)](./STL): Focused on STL components like vectors, lists, maps, and algorithms that simplify data handling in C++.
- [Advanced Topics](./Advanced): Explores more complex concepts like pointers, memory management, templates, and multi-threading.
- [Exercises](./Exercises): Contains coding exercises and practice problems to reinforce C++ concepts, with solutions provided for self-assessment.

## Description of Each Section

### Basics
The **Basics** section covers essential C++ concepts and syntax, providing a solid foundation for more advanced programming. Topics include variables, control structures, and functions.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
The **OOP** section delves into Object-Oriented Programming in C++. It covers the principles of classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create structured and reusable code.

### Standard Template Library (STL)
The **STL** section introduces the Standard Template Library in C++. It provides data structures like vectors, lists, and maps, along with algorithms that make data handling more efficient.

### Advanced Topics
The **Advanced** section includes more complex C++ topics, such as pointers, templates, file handling, and multi-threading, which are essential for mastering C++.

### Exercises
The **Exercises** section offers practice problems to apply C++ concepts. Each exercise has a solution to help reinforce your learning and track your progress.
