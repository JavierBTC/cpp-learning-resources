# Standard Template Library (STL)

This folder is dedicated to the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. STL provides a set of powerful tools for working with data structures and algorithms, making C++ programming more efficient and expressive. The resources here cover the most commonly used STL components.

## Topics Covered
- Vectors, Lists, and Deques
- Maps and Sets
- Iterators and Algorithms
- Stacks, Queues, and Priority Queues

Each section includes examples to demonstrate how STL containers and algorithms can be used to handle and process data in C++ programs.
